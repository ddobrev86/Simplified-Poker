This is a project for my Introduction to Programming Practicum Course at FMI, Sofia University. It simulates a game of simplified poker.
Each game executes the following steps:
  1. Create a deck of playing cards and shuffle it
  2. Deal 3 cards to each player (between 2 and 9 players)
  3. Calculate each player's points, based on his hand
  4. A betting phase, where the players can raise, call or fold
  5. After the betting phase, the player with the most points wins
     5.1 If two or more players have the most points, they go into a tie and play the game again for the total pot
     5.2. If only one player has the most points, then he takes the pot and the game ends
  6. At the end of the game, the user can choose to play a new game or save the current one. Once saved, a game can be continued later from where it was left off.
